  "description" : "[h1]Nicemice have arrived![/h1]\n\nThis mod alliows you to play as a shortstack mouse from space. Exciting!\nNicemice are about 3 blocks tall, much shorter than normal players!\n\nCreating a new race is a ton of work, and there are still several placeholder assets in the mod. However, I believe they are ready for multiplayer testing - which is where you come in!\n\nPlease provide your feedback, suggestions, and other comments in the mod's discussion threads, the comments below, or the Nicemice Discord server!\n\nI'm struggling a lot with the clothing - if you think you can help, please let me know!\n\n(Also, if you like the mod, click the little thumbs-up icon pls & ty, love u)\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]CURRENT MOD FEATURES[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] Playable species\n[*] 400 fur color combinations\n[*] 13 ear designs\n[*] 15 hair designs\n[*] Flat and busty chest options\n[*] Custom ship layout (now with BYOS support!)\n[*] NPC spawners, tenant, and crew support\n[*] Race-specific dialog for many different species\n[*] Basic clothing templates for modders\n[*] Starter jumpsuit\n[*] Armor for tiers 1 through 6\n[*] Swappable tails that automatically match your fur and skin colors\n[*] Custom namegen config\n[*] Custom flag\n[*] Improved S.A.I.L station (now with custom S.A.I.L chip support!)\n[*] Custom sfx for npc chatter and player damage\n[*] and more!\n[/list]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]WEIRD TECHNICAL STUFF[/h1]\n\nCheck out the devblog:\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3485543399/597401650324317152/\n\nI recommend randomizing until you get the fur base color you want, then adjusting to get the secondary color you want.\n\nNicemice use their own clothing templates. They aren't compatible with vanilla clothing. I am working on some scripts that will automatically swap vanilla items for nicemice items when worn by nicemice. Currently the only items that use this are the HAZMAT suit cosmetics. If you find a HAZMAT suit, try it on! It should fit you.\n\nI'm still working on the ships. Please give me your feedback on the T6+ ships when you unlock them!\n\nI had to modify the sensor that opens the door in the Lunar Base mission because nicemice were too short to trigger it\n\nNicemice NPCs use a different species than the player (nicemice_npc) to prevent some garish randomizing with eye colors. This way, the player can customize their eyes to be whatever color they desire, without creating a bunch of very weird-looking npc mice with bizarre eye-fur combinations.\n\nA lot of the armor graphics are placeholders. I wanted to get something visible and wearable into the mod before releasing the beta on the Workshop to make sure that a player could progress all the way to the end of the vanilla game experience while playing a mouse character. I've tested gameplay all the way up-to and past defeating the Ruin, so all the armor recipes work and don't require admin mode to use them or any of that silly nonsense that happens in like 75% of race mods.\n\nHonestly though, this is just a ton of work. I can try to do most of it by myself but I'm interested in help, so drop by the Discord server if you want to help make Nicemice even nicer!\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]CAN I USE THESE ASSETS FOR SOME OTHER PROJECT?[/h1]\nYes. Starbound needs more shortstacks.\nEverything in this mod is released under the MIT license.\n\n[hr][/hr]\nDiscord server if you want to come visit:\nhttps://discord.gg/A2UgshjkJ2\n\nSend me a direct message or join the Discord server if you're interested in playing on our multiplayer server!\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/LoftyLoftyLoftyLoftyLofty/myworkshopfiles/?appid=211820]Check out my other mods, too![/url]\n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/LoftyLoftyLoftyLoftyLofty/sb_nicemice\n\nko-fi if you enjoy my work â™¥\nhttps://ko-fi.com/loftyloftyloftyloftylofty",
