//this object is only used in the lunar base mission and the shockhopper mission
//when nicemice approach the door in the lunar base mission, they're not tall enough to trigger the sensor
//this patch adjusts the sensor range to allow nicemice players to play the mission normally
//it also allows players to open the lunar base mission door if they have distortion sphere active etc
